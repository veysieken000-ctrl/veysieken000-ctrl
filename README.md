Hebûn → Zanabûn → Mabûn → Rasterast → Zanistarast  
Being Knowledge Economy Method Civilizational Synthesis  

---

Knowledge = f(Being)  
Economy = f(Knowledge, Responsibility)  
Civilization = f(Truth, Structure, Justice)

Truth > Power

## Ontological-Epistemological System Design  
### Truth-Centered Civilizational Architecture

## Core Thesis

Civilization collapses when epistemology disconnects from ontology.

Modern systems are built on:

- Power-centered governance
- Interest-based economics
- Narrative-driven information

This project proposes:

- Truth-centered governance
- Reality-aligned epistemology
- Ontologically grounded institutional design

---

## System Formula

Civilizational Stability =  
Alignment(Ontology, Epistemology, Ethics, Power)

Where:

- Ontology → What is real  
- Epistemology → How truth is known  
- Ethics → How action is constrained  
- Power → How force is structured  

Misalignment → Collapse  
Alignment → Stability

---

## Research Areas

- Meta-Political Structures
- Institutional Truth Mechanisms
- Post-Ideological Governance
- Structural Epistemology
- Civilization-Scale Design

---

## Status

Framework under active construction.

## System Position

This framework proposes:

• Ontology-centered knowledge  
• Responsibility-based economy  
• Truth-prioritized governance  
• Civilizational reconstruction through structural justice  

---

## Operational Directive

Build structures aligned with Being.  
Produce knowledge aligned with Truth.  
Design economy aligned with Responsibility.  

Civilization is not inherited.  
It is engineered.

This framework is not debate-oriented.
It is test-oriented.

Critique must be structural, not rhetorical.
