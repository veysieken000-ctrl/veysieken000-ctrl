## Ontological-Epistemological System Design  
### Truth-Centered Civilizational Architecture

---

## Core Thesis

Civilization collapses when epistemology disconnects from ontology.

Modern systems are built on:

- Power-centered governance
- Interest-based economics
- Narrative-driven information

This project proposes:

- Truth-centered governance
- Reality-aligned epistemology
- Ontologically grounded institutional design

## System Formula

Civilizational Stability =  
Alignment(Ontology, Epistemology, Ethics, Power)

Where:

- Ontology → What is real  
- Epistemology → How truth is known  
- Ethics → How action is constrained  
- Power → How force is structured  

Misalignment → Collapse  
Alignment → Stability
